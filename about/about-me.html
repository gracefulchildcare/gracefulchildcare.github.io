      	<h4>About Me</h4>
      	<img class="small-img-l" src="../images-final/chen.png" alt="Xiaowei Chen">
      	<p class="main-content-r">My name is Xiaowei Chen, child care provider and founder of Graceful Child Care, LLC (GCC). I was born in China, where I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Fuzhou University. Before moving to the United States, I was a college teacher and computer engineer at Fuzhou University from 1989 to 2004. I have been living in Seattle since 2004. My husband, Baohai Shao, is a faculty member in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. My husband and I have two children. Our son is currently a sophomore at Yale University, and our daughter is a seventh grader at Jane Addams Middle School as part of Seattle Public Schools' Highly Capable Cohort (HCC) Program.</p>
      	<p class="main-content-r">I provide a licensed home child care in compliance with the Washington State Department of Early Learning, following all registration standards for a home child care facility. Graceful Child Care is inspected annually by the Department of Early Learning. Graceful Child Care participated in the Early Achievers program, part of the Washington State Quality Rating Improvement System (QRIS) for child care facilities that is committed to providing high-quality early learning experiences for children from birth to 5 years old. We are now rated at level 3, which is awarded to facilities that have achieved a quality level of excellence and have demonstrated quality through an on-site assessment focused on the learning environment and interactions between teachers and children. I have also obtained the Washington State Stackable Short Early Care and Education (ECE) Certificate with a specialization in Family Child Care. In addition, I have been taking online college level courses on early education to gain updated knowledge on how to better teach young children in today’s modern society.</p>
      	<p class="main-content-r">If you have any questions or concerns, I can be reached by phone, email, or mail.</p>
