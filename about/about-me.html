      	<h4>About Me</h4>
      	<img class="small-img-l" src="../images-final/chen.png" alt="Xiaowei Chen">
      	<p class="main-content-r">My name is Xiaowei Chen, child care provider and founder of Graceful Child Care, LLC (GCC). I was born in China, where I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Fuzhou University. Prior to moving to the United States, I was a college teacher and computer engineer at Fuzhou University from 1989 to 2004. I have been living in Seattle since 2004. My husband, Baohai Shao, is a faculty member in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. My husband and I have two children, an 18-year old son and an 11-year old daughter. Both of them are in the Highly Capable Cohort (HCC) program at Seattle Public Schools.</p>
      	<p class="main-content-r">I provide a licensed home child care in compliance with the Washington State Department of Early Learning. I have CPR (cardio pulmonary resuscitation), First Aid and HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) training, as well as a food handler permit card. I have finished 20 hours of STARS (state training and registry system) training. I followed all the standards for registration and had a criminal history check performed for each family member over 12 years of age. Graceful Child Care is inspected regularly by the Department of Early Learning. If you have any questions or concerns, I can be reached by phone, email, or mail.</p>
