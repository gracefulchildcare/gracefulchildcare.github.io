      	<h4>Mission</h4>
      	<p class="main-content">I believe that children have the right to grow in a safe, nurturing environment where they feel comfortable and secure. Each child is different, and at Graceful Child Care, children are cherished for who they are. Each child is respected for their uniqueness and in turn learns to respect the uniqueness of others. In every age group, children are encouraged to engage in activities that are intellectually stimulating, developmentally appropriate, hands-on and creative. GCC will support and nurture each child's own timeline for growth and development. Children will be guided in developing a positive self-esteem through love and respect, as well as academic and physical skills at their own development level.</p>
        <p class="main-content">I provide family-style care for children in a loving atmosphere. I have designed my own program with a structured curriculum that caters to each child's individual needs. I believe that music, communication, and movement are very important parts of a child's healthy development. I care for a very small group, as it is my belief that fewer children equal better care. Because I am able to give more individualized attention than a large center, each child can grow according to their needs. I provide parents with daily reports and weekly newsletters in an effort to communicate updates during this wonderful time of growth, exploration and change. I will also support parents in approaches to positive parenting. For example, strong parent-child communication mixed with firm, yet caring, discipline will help your child become a healthy and independent adult. Spending time each day talking and listening to your child will help create stronger bonds. Preschoolers need clear directions, so say what you mean and mean what you say. Reading to your child is a great way to support their learning and spend quality time with them.</p>
        <p class="main-content">While attending GCC, children are supported and encouraged to:</p>
        <div class="key-points">
        	<div class="key-point"><p>Be caring and respectful, nurturing self-esteem in themselves and in others.</p></div>
        	<div class="key-point"><p>Care for their environment.</p></div>
        	<div class="key-point"><p>Develop enthusiasm and pleasure for new and challenging experiences.</p></div>
        	<div class="key-point"><p>Develop self-discipline and inner motivation.</p></div>
        	<div class="key-point"><p>Grow in self-confidence and independence.</p></div>
        </div>
        <p class="main-content">Specialists think that a child's most critical learning period occurs during the first six years of life. It is my goal to provide the highest quality care for your child in a safe, loving, and stimulating environment. I will provide a program that will meet the needs of both the parents and the child and prepare children for school. I will maintain safe and sanitary conditions and provide a structured environment that will help children learn and develop in a happy and loving atmosphere.</p>
